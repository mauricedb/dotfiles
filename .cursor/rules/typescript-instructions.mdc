# TypeScript Instructions

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Always use curly braces in conditionals.
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Use declarative JSX.

# Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use PascalCase for component names.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
