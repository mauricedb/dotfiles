# Code Quality and Pre-commit Checks

This rule ensures consistent code quality and prevents committing broken code.

## Mandatory Quality Checks

- **ALWAYS** run `pnpm lint` before completing any task or suggesting code changes.
- **ALWAYS** run `pnpm tsc` to verify TypeScript compilation.
- **NEVER** commit or suggest committing code that has linting errors or TypeScript errors.
- If linting or type errors are found, **IMMEDIATELY** fix them before proceeding.
- Maximum 3 attempts to fix linting/type errors on the same file - if still broken after 3 attempts, ask the user for guidance.
- After making any code changes, automatically run both lint and typecheck commands to validate the changes.

## Commands to Run

```bash
pnpm lint      # ESLint checking
pnpm tsc       # TypeScript compilation check
```

## Error Handling Protocol

1. Run both commands after any code changes
2. If errors found, fix immediately
3. Re-run commands to verify fixes
4. If unable to fix after 3 attempts, seek user guidance
5. Only proceed when both commands pass successfully# Code Quality and Pre-commit Checks
